## Polynomial Time
When we say an algorithm runs in **polynomial time**, we mean that:

Its **worst-case running time** can be expressed as a **polynomial function** of the input size.

Like the following, where $ n $ = input size:

- $O(n)$ – linear time  
- $O(n^2)$ – quadratic time  
- $O(n^3)$ – cubic time  
- ...  
- $O(n^k)$ – for some constant $k$

Polynomial time is considered **efficient**.  
It contrasts with **exponential time** algorithms, like $O(2^n)$, which become intractable as $n$ grows.
