# Grad School Notes

## **Supervised Learning** 
Function approximation from examples  
**Goal**: Learn a function \( y = f(x) \) from labeled data  
**Given**: Pairs of inputs and outputs \((x, y)\)  
**Learn**: A function \( f(x) \) that maps inputs to outputs and generalizes to unseen \( x \)  
**Examples**: classification, regression

## **Unsupervised Learning**  
Clustering, description, compression  
**Goal**: Learn data structure and description from input data alone  
**Given**: Inputs \( x \)  
**Learn**: A function \( f(x) \) that captures structure, clusters, or reduces dimensionality  

## **Reinforcement Learning**  
Trial and error with feedback  
**Goal**: Learn how to make decisions  
**Given**: States \( x \), actions \( y \), and delayed rewards \( z \)  
**Learn**: A function or policy \( y = f(x) \) that maps states to actions to maximize reward  
**Examples**: games, robotics, recommendation systems

## **Future Projects**

When I finish grad school  
- Junk Yard: Auto parts data base: Add all relevant auto parts in the world to database capturing key info like, photo, size, weight, id numbers  
    1. How do we define relevant? We need to find most popular reused parts. Based on car model? Car date? Parts used across models?
    2. What about rare parts? Should we always keep since the world is running out of them?
- Junk Yard: Input live photo or video into CV component connected to database to access entry for that part  
- Stocks: Gather fresh data to plug into Stock Predictor  

Note: Keep notes on all steps in research spike.
